In this section, we will discuss symmetric encryption and decryption using AES-256-GCM,focusing on best practices to ensure robust security.
AES-256-GCM is a widely used and highly secure cryptographic algorithm, but its strength depends heavily on proper implementation.
Key best practices include never reusing initialization vectors (IVs), as doing so can compromise the encryption's integrity.
It is also crucial to always derive a secure encryption key from the user-provided key using a strong key derivation function
like Argon2 or HKDF. In certain cases, itâ€™s recommended to encapsulate the Data Encryption Key (DEK) by encrypting it separately,
providing an additional layer of security for sensitive operations.
Following these principles ensures that your symmetric encryption implementations remain secure and resilient against common cryptographic attacks.


## Symmetric secure data encrypt

Method to encrypt data using AES-256-GCM with a randomly generated Data Encryption Key (DEK).
It ensures security by generating unique IVs and salts, securely deriving encryption keys,
and encrypting the DEK using a master key.
The final output is a concatenation of the encrypted DEK and the encrypted data, ensuring both confidentiality and key encapsulation.

### `symmetricSecureDataEncrypt`

```typescript
public symmetricSecureDataEncrypt (
  data: string | Buffer,
): Promise<Buffer>;
```

**Parameters:**

| Name                      | Type             | Default | Description                 |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| **data** <RequiredLabel/> | string \| Buffer |         | String or buffer to encrypt |

**Outputs:**

As output, it will return a [Buffer][1] `<Buffer cc 2b.....cd a1 08>`

#### **Usage:**
```typescript
async exampleEncrypt(
  data: string,
): Promise<string> {
  const bufferData = Buffer.from(data, 'utf-8');
  const encryptedData = await this.cryptographyService.symmetricSecureDataEncrypt(data);
  return encryptedData.toString('hex')
}
```

## Symmetric secure data encrypt

Method to decrypt data that was encrypted using the method [`symmetricSecureDataEncrypt`][2]

:::warning
Remember that the previous data must have been encrypted using [`symmetricSecureDataEncrypt`][2] method.

### `symmetricSecureDataDecrypt`

```typescript
public symmetricSecureDataDecrypt (
  ata: string | Buffer
): Promise<Buffer>;
```

**Parameters:**

| Name                      | Type             | Default | Description                 |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| **data** <RequiredLabel/> | string \| Buffer |         | String or buffer to decrypt |

**Outputs:**

As output, it will return a [Buffer][1] `<Buffer cc 2b.....cd a1 08>`


#### **Usage:**
```typescript
async exampleDecrypt(
  data: string,
): Promise<string> {
  const bufferData = Buffer.from(data, 'hex');
  const decryptedData = await this.cryptographyService.symmetricSecureDataDecrypt(data);
  return decryptedData.toString('utf-8')
}
```
