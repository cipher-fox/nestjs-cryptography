In this section, we will explore how to securely hash passwords using [Argon2][2],
one of the most advanced and secure password-hashing algorithms available today.
Developed as a winner of the [Password Hashing Competition (PHC)][1], Argon2 is designed to protect against brute-force attacks,
both by consuming significant computational resources and by utilizing memory-hard functions.
This makes it a preferred choice for modern security practices.



## Create Argon2 hash

Method to create a hash of a text/password using Argon2 algorithm.

### `createArgonHashFromPassword`

```typescript
public createArgonHashFromPassword (
  data: string | Buffer,
): string;
```


**Parameters:**

| Name                      | Type             | Default | Description      |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------|------------------|
| **data** <RequiredLabel/> | string \| Buffer |         | Password to hash |


**Module Parameters:**

:::info
Internally, this method uses certain parameters that are defined at the module level during initialization,
as we have seen [previously][4]. The internal parameters used and their corresponding configuration keys are as follows:

  - **hashLength**: Specifies the length of the resulting hash.
      This is set via [`hashing.password.outputKeyLength`][5] and determines the size of the final hash in bytes.

  - **type**: Defines the variant of Argon2 to use (_argon2i_, _argon2d_, or _argon2id_).
      This is configured using [`hashing.password.argon2Type`][6].

  - **memoryCost**: Sets the amount of memory (in KB) that the algorithm will use during the hashing process.
      This value is determined by [`hashing.password.memoryCost`][7] and plays a critical role in resisting brute-force attacks.

  - **timeCost**: Specifies the number of iterations or the amount of computational work Argon2 will perform.
      It is defined via [`hashing.password.timeCost`][8] to ensure a balance between security and performance.
:::


**Outputs:**

As output, it will return a string of type: `$argon2i$v=19$m=4096,t=3,p=1$c2g56.....jk7A`

> Where the options `argon2i`, `v=19`, `m=4096`, `t=3` and `p=1` may vary
depending on the [options][3] supplied to CryptographyModule when it has been [configured][4].


**Usage:**
```typescript
async secureUserPassword(
  plainPassword: string,
): Promise<string> {
  const _buffer = Buffer.from(plainPassword, 'utf-8');
  const hashedPassword = await this.cryptographyService.createArgonHashFromPassword(_buffer);
  return hashedPassword.toString();
}
```



## Verify Argon2 hash

Method to verify if an existing Argon2 hash matches the desired text/password.

### `verifyArgonHashFromPassword`

```typescript
public verifyArgonHashFromPassword (
  hash: string,
  data: string | Buffer,
): Promise<boolean>;
```

**Parameters:**

| Name                      | Type             | Default | Description                 |
|---------------------------|------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| **hash** <RequiredLabel/> | string           |         | String of the existing hash |
| **data** <RequiredLabel/> | Buffer \| string |         | Buffer or string to verify  |

**Outputs:**

As output, it will return `true` if both matches, or `false` if not.


**Usage:**
```typescript
async checkUserPassword(
  plainPassword: string,
  hashedPassword: string
): Promise<boolean> {
  const _buffer = Buffer.from(plainPassword, 'utf-8');
  return await this.cryptographyService.verifyArgonHashFromPassword(hashedPassword, plainPassword)
}
```
