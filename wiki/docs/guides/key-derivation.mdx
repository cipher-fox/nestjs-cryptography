The upcoming section will delve into methods for generating cryptographically secure keys from user-provided passwords.
This process is crucial because raw passwords are often not secure enough for cryptographic purposes
due to their relatively low entropy. By using a key derivation function, we can transform these passwords
into secure keys that are suitable for encryption, hashing, or other cryptographic operations.

We will be using **Argon2** for this purpose, which is one of the most secure and modern key derivation functions available.
Argon2 is specifically designed to resist attacks such as brute force and side-channel attacks
by incorporating memory-hard and CPU-intensive computations. This makes it an ideal choice for
converting user passwords into robust cryptographic keys.



## Derive a key

Method to derive a user supplied key into a cryptographically secure one.

### `deriveMasterKey`


```typescript
public deriveMasterKey (
  masterKey: string | Buffer,
  salt: Buffer,
  length: number,
): Promise<Buffer>;
```


#### **Parameters:**

| Name                           | Type             | Default                    | Description                                         |
|--------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **masterKey** <RequiredLabel/> | string \| Buffer | false                      | String or buffer of the key to derive               |
| **salt** <RequiredLabel/>      | Buffer           | false                      | Salt to increase the security of the key derivation |
| **length**                     | number           | [`kdf.outputKeyLength`][3] | The desired derived output key length               |


#### **Module Parameters:**

:::info
Internally, this method uses certain parameters that are defined at the module level during initialization,
as we have seen [previously][2]. The internal parameters used and their corresponding configuration keys are as follows:

  - **hashLength**: Specifies the length of the resulting derived key.
      If this option is not provided, then it is set via [`kdf.outputKeyLength`][3]
and determines the size of the final hash in bytes.

  - **type**: Defines the variant of Argon2 to use (_argon2i_, _argon2d_, or _argon2id_).
This is configured using [`kdf.argon2Type`][4].

  - **memoryCost**: Sets the amount of memory (in KB) that the algorithm will use during the hashing process.
This value is determined by [`kdf.memoryCost`][5] and plays a critical role in resisting brute-force attacks.

  - **timeCost**: Specifies the number of iterations or the amount of computational work Argon2 will perform.
It is defined via [`kdf.timeCost`][6] to ensure a balance between security and performance.
:::


#### **Outputs:**

As output, it will return a [Buffer][1] `<Buffer cc 2b.....cd a1 08>`


#### **Usage:**
```typescript
async deriveSecureKeyFromMasterKey(
  key: string,
): Promise<string> {
  const keyBuffer = Buffer.from(key, 'utf-8');
  const salt = this.cryptographyService.generateSymmetricKey(128);
  const derivedKey = await this.cryptographyService.deriveMasterKey(keyBuffer, salt.export(), 256)
  return derivedKey.toString('hex')
}
```
