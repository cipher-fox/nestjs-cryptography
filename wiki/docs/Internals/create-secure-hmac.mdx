In the following section, you will see a diagram of the cryptographic operations performed when calling the method [`createSecureHmac`][1]

This method performs several cryptographic operations, including generating a salt,
deriving a secure key using HKDF with the sha3-256 hashing algorithm, creating an HMAC,
and returning the concatenated salt and HMAC result. The diagram will illustrate these steps clearly.
